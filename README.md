# Qolbi Nurwandi Yunus 👋

I'm Obi from Indonesia. I'm currently doing full-time learning as a student of Software Engineering. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React and Vue, as well I had a good experience working in WordPress. I majored in Multimedia when I was in high school so I do stuff like UI and design in general.
